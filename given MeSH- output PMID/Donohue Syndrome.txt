AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS), a rare autosomal recessive disease which represents severe
      insulin resistance, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, hypertrichosis, and
      dysmorphic features, is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. 
      Here, we have reported the clinical, molecular, and biochemical characterizations
      of a patient with DS. In this article, we have also reported a case with 2 novel 
      INSR mutations and the DS phenotype. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we
      screened 27 known genes involved in inherited maturity-onset diabetes of the
      young (MODY) and identified compound heterozygous mutations in the INSR gene in
      the patient with DS, c.62T>G (p.L21R) and c.2563G>T (p.V855F). The positive
      correlation of these mutations with DS was further validated by Sanger DNA
      sequencing of his lineal consanguinity, indicating that these pathogenic
      mutations were inherited maternally and paternally, respectively. Therefore, our 
      finding expanded the number of reported cases of this rare disease and the
      mutation spectrum of INSR mutation, suggesting that NGS is an accurate, rapid,
      and cost-effective method for the genetic diagnosis of this rare disease.

AB  - The insulin receptor (INSR) gene was analyzed in four patients with severe
      insulin resistance, revealing five novel mutations and a deletion that removed
      exon 2. A patient with Donohue syndrome (DS) had a novel p.V657F mutation in the 
      second fibronectin type III domain (FnIII-2), which contains the alpha-beta
      cleavage site and part of the insulin-binding site. The mutant INSR was expressed
      in Chinese hamster ovary cells, revealing that it reduced insulin proreceptor
      processing and impaired activation of downstream signaling cascades. Using online
      databases, we analyzed 82 INSR missense mutations and demonstrated that mutations
      causing DS were more frequently located in the FnIII domains than those causing
      the milder type A insulin resistance (P = 0.016). In silico structural analysis
      revealed that missense mutations predicted to severely impair hydrophobic core
      formation and stability of the FnIII domains all caused DS, whereas those
      predicted to produce localized destabilization and to not affect folding of the
      FnIII domains all caused the less severe Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. These
      results suggest the importance of the FnIII domains, provide insight into the
      molecular mechanism of severe insulin resistance, will aid early diagnosis, and
      will provide potential novel targets for treating extreme insulin resistance.

AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to
      mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) which is mapped to 19p13.2. RMS is 
      characterized by acanthosis nigricans, generalized lanugo, tooth and nail
      dysplasia, high nasal bridge, and growth retardation. A 5-year-old female patient
      was referred due to acanthosis nigricans and generalized lanugo. On her physical 
      examination, severe acanthosis nigricans of the neck, axillae, the external
      genitalia and antecubital regions, generalized lanugo, mildly decreased
      subcutaneous fat, dysmorphic facial features, and polydactyly on her left hand
      were noted. Insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance were found.
      Sequence analysis of the INSR in the patient revealed c.3529+5G>A mutation in
      homozygous state. RMS should be suspected in a patient with characteristic
      physical features and insulin resistance.

PG  - 2023803
AB  - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex disorders can
      create, destroy, or modify protein coding sites. Single amino acid substitutions 
      in the insulin receptor (INSR) are the most common forms of genetic variations
      that account for various diseases like Donohue syndrome or Leprechaunism,
      Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and type A insulin resistance. We analyzed the
      deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in INSR gene based on different
      computational methods. Analysis of INSR was initiated with PROVEAN followed by
      PolyPhen and I-Mutant servers to investigate the effects of 57 nsSNPs retrieved
      from database of SNP (dbSNP). A total of 18 mutations that were found to exert
      damaging effects on the INSR protein structure and function were chosen for
      further analysis. Among these mutations, our computational analysis suggested
      that 13 nsSNPs decreased protein stability and might have resulted in loss of
      function. Therefore, the probability of their involvement in disease
      predisposition increases. In the lack of adequate prior reports on the possible
      deleterious effects of nsSNPs, we have systematically analyzed and characterized 
      the functional variants in coding region that can alter the expression and
      function of INSR gene. In silico characterization of nsSNPs affecting INSR gene
      function can aid in better understanding of genetic differences in disease
      susceptibility.

      Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome from the United Arab Emirates.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to identify, clinically and molecularly, the
      causality of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome in an Emirati family. It is one of the
      monogenic syndromes of abnormal glucose homeostasis, which result from insulin
      receptor defects. METHODS: A novel nonsynonymous variant in the INSR gene was
      uncovered by whole exome sequencing and confirmed using Sanger sequencing in the 
      patient and his parents. Various in silico tools were utilized to analyze the
      functional consequences of the variant. RESULTS: Results revealed a previously
      unreported INSR variant in the family: c.421C>T (p.Arg141Trp). Homozygosity for
      the variant was found in the patient, while both parents were heterozygous.
      CONCLUSION: The nonsynonymous protein change hit a highly conserved arginine
      residue in the insulin-binding alpha-subunit of the receptor and was deemed
      'functionally damaging' by a myriad of bioinformatics tools. This report is a
      step forward along the way of achieving a better molecular and clinical
      characterization of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome.

LID - 10.1177/0897190016645036 [doi]
AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is a rare genetic disorder resulting from mutations in
      the insulin receptor and is associated with high degrees of insulin resistance.
      These patients are prone to complications secondary to their hyperglycemia
      including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We report the case of a 19-year-old male
      with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome presenting with DKA who required doses of up to
      500 U/h (10.6 U/kg/h) of insulin. The patient's insulin infusion was originally
      compounded with U-100 regular insulin, although to minimize volume, the product
      was compounded with U-500 insulin. The DKA eventually resolved requiring infusion
      rates ranging from 400 to 500 U/h. Although numerous opportunities for medication
      errors exist with the use of U-500 insulin, this case outlines the safe use of
      concentrated intravenous insulin when clinically indicated for patients requiring
      extremely high doses of insulin to control blood glucose.

AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare and lethal autosomal recessive disease caused by 
      mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene, manifesting marked insulin
      resistance, severe growth retardation, hypertrichosis, and characteristic
      dysmorphic features. We describe a new case of Donohue syndrome born at 37 weeks'
      gestation of unrelated parents and presented with intra-uterine growth
      retardation, nipple hypertrophy, macropenis, distended abdomen, hirsutism and
      dysmorphic features. The clinical course showed failure to thrive, and episodes
      of alternating hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Laboratory tests revealed direct
      hyperbilirubinemia. The diagnosis of Donohue syndrome was established based on
      the above clinical characteristics and determination of the INSR mutation. He was
      found to have homozygous nonsense mutation c. 2270 C>T (Arg924X) at exon 14 of
      the INSR gene. He later developed enterocolitis and died at 3 months old.
      Prenatal diagnosis was performed for the family via chorionic villous biopsy. We 
      try to explain gastrointestinal dysfunction seen in our patient.

TI  - First molecular diagnosis of Donohue syndrome in Africa: novel unusual
      insertion/deletion mutation in the INSR gene.
PG  - 165-73
LID - 10.1007/s11033-016-3951-9 [doi]
AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disease affecting less
      than one in a million life births. It represents the most severe form of insulin 
      resistance due to mutations involving the insulin receptor (IR) gene "INSR". DS
      is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation with failure-to-thrive,
      lipoatrophy, acanthosis nigricans, hypertrichosis, and dysmorphic features. An
      exhaustive INSR gene sequencing was performed after PCR amplification of coding
      exons and introns boundaries. Bioinformatic tools, including ESEfinder, MFOLD and
      Proter software were also used to predict the impact of INSR mutation on INSR on 
      gene expression as well as on the protein structure and function. The results
      have shown a novel unusual c.3003_3012delinsGGAAG (p.S1001_D1004delinsRE)
      insertion/deletion (indel) mutation within the exon 16 in the three patients,
      which represent the fourth indel mutation within the INSR gene. The mutation
      modifies the secondary structure of DNA and RNA, as well as the composition of
      exonic splicing enhancers of exon 16. Moreover, despite the conservation of the
      secondary structure of the IR, the p.S1001_D1004delinsRE in-frame mutation is
      accompanied by the loss of four amino acids replaced by two residues of different
      nature and hydrophobicity level in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. The 
      results have confirmed the role of the juxtamembrane domain of IR involved in a
      crucial interaction of the IR with cellular effectors essentially the IR
      substrate 1 (IRS-1), the SHC and the Nck proteins that ensure the signal mediated
      by the insulin transduction pathway in target cells. Our findings have also
      proven the genotype/phenotype correlation between INSR mutation and DS phenotype 
      severity.

TI  - Classic Case Report of Donohue Syndrome (Leprechaunism; OMIM *246200): The Impact
      of Consanguineous Mating.
PG  - e2710
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000002710 [doi]
AB  - Donohue syndrome ([DS]; leprechaunism) describes a genetic autosomal recessive
      disorder that results from the presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous
      mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR; 19p13.3-p13.2).Donohue syndrome is 
      associated with a fatal congenital form of dwarfism with features of intrauterine
      and postnatal growth retardation, exaggerated hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism 
      and dysmorphic abnormalities.We present a case of DS owing to the rarity of this 
      syndrome (1 case in every million births). We discuss how the disease presents,
      its genetic underpinning, and its prevention.The case was encountered in an Arab 
      male born on 1 September, 2014, for consanguineous parents. The delivery was via 
      cesarean section at 37 weeks gestation due to severe intrauterine growth
      restriction and nonprogress labor term. The patient was admitted to the Neonatal 
      Intensive Care Unit due to infection, and jaundice. Dysmorphic features,
      abnormalities of the craniofacial region, low birth weight, skin abnormalities,
      abdominal distension and hypertrichosis were observed. Laboratory examinations
      showed, hyperinsulinism, increased C-peptide, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and
      anemia.The diagnosis of DS was done based on the combinations of typical
      dysmorphic characteristics, clinical evaluation, supported by genetic analysis
      and exaggerated biochemical results. Genetic diagnosis of DS was performed
      through analysis of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A qualitative
      real-time PCR was used, to monitor the amplification of a targeted DNA molecule
      during the PCR. Other technique using sequencing of the INSR gene, which permits 
      genetic diagnosis, counseling, and antenatal diagnoses in subsequent pregnancies,
      were also performed.Treatment of DS is supportive and requires the combined
      efforts of a multidisciplinary team, which include pediatricians,
      endocrinologists, dermatologists, and other health care professionals. Currently,
      treatment with recombinant insulin-like growth factor 1 demonstrates
      effectiveness, and a combination treatment with insulin-like growth factor
      binding protein 3 resulted in an increased lifespan.There is a scarcity of
      genetic information on DS among the Arab population. Consanguinity is one of
      underlying reasons for the appearance of rare genetic disorders. Inbreeding has
      long been considered a controversial phenomenon. Genetic counseling and
      overwhelming the alertness of the negative consequences of consanguinity on
      public health are warranted.

AB  - Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome are caused by
      mutations in the insulin receptor gene and are associated with extreme insulin
      resistance. Clinically these syndromes appear to represent points on a continuum 
      of severity of receptor dysfunction, rather than completely distinct syndromes.
      We investigated a Libyan infant with growth retardation, facial dysmorphism
      (elfin-like features), acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism. Fasting hypoglycaemia 
      and postprandial hyperglycaemia with persistent hyperinsulinemia were found. A
      novel homozygous missense mutation was found in exon 2, resulting in a
      substitution of a glycine-132 for a serine in the INSR alpha-subunit (c.394G > A;
      p.Gly132Ser). At age ten, he developed diabetes mellitus. At age eleven, patient 
      is still alive with mental retardation and severe growth retardation.

AB  - We report the case of a patient with Donohue syndrome who died of heart failure
      due to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A literature survey revealed that
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in 30% of these patients and was often
      fatal. Therefore, every patient with Donohue syndrome should be screened for
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

LID - bcr2015210019 [pii]
AB  - Donohue syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by severe
      loss-of-function mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. The diagnosis is 
      made on clinical, biochemical and genetic grounds. Mutations are found on
      chromosome 19p13.2, and code for mutations in the INSR gene. Treatment is
      challenging and often unsuccessful, and relies on maintaining normoglycaemia and 
      avoiding fasting; in some patients, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 
      (rhIGF-1) has been trialled. The prognosis is poor, with most babies dying in
      infancy. Ethically, it is important to consider the benefit versus burden of
      treatment, the quality of life of the surviving patient and the parents' wishes, 
      when making decisions regarding withholding or withdrawing care.

TI  - Case Report: When an Induced Illness Looks Like a Rare Disease.
PG  - e1361-5
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-4165 [doi]
AB  - The recognition of fabricated illness (FI) in a child represents a diagnostic
      challenge. The suspicion of FI often arises from the discrepancy between
      laboratory tests and clinical history. For instance, (unnecessary) insulin
      injections by caregivers has been widely described as a common cause of
      factitious hypoglycemia that may be inferred from discrepancies between plasma
      insulin and c-peptide. However, contemporary administration of insulin with an
      insulin secretagogue (glyburide), and of additional drugs, can make the
      diagnostic pathway problematic. We report the case of a child 4 years and 11
      months old, admitted for alternance of hypo- and hyperglycemia associated with
      hirsutism, hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and neurodevelopmental delay. All these
      features were compatible with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, a rare disorder of
      severe insulin resistance linked to mutations of insulin receptor. At admission, 
      plasma insulin levels were high during hypoglycemic episodes, but c-peptide was
      repeatedly in the normal range. The genetic analysis of insulin receptor was
      negative. The story of previous hospital admissions, inconsistency between
      insulin and c-peptide values, and association between hypoglycemic episodes in
      the child with the presence of the mother, raised the suspicion of FI. This
      hypothesis was confirmed by a video recording that revealed the administration by
      the mother of multiple drugs (insulin, glyburide, progesterone, and furosemide)
      that mimicked most of the features of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, including
      hirsutism and hypoglycemia with coincident, inappropriately normal c-peptide
      values due to the administration of the insulin secretagogue. Our case indicates 
      that inconsistency among consecutive diagnostic tests should be regarded as a
      clue of FI.

      the beta-Subunit of INSR That Cause Severe Insulin Resistance Syndrome.
PG  - 73-8
LID - 10.1159/000381624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Donohue syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal recessive
      disorder caused by mutations in INSR. This study describes the clinical course of
      a patient with Donohue syndrome, and we also evaluated the molecular and
      functional characteristics of 2 novel INSR mutations. METHODS: Our patient was a 
      male newborn with acanthosis nigricans, lack of subcutaneous fat, hirsutism,
      thick lips, and high serum insulin levels, all of which are characteristic of
      Donohue syndrome. INSR mutation analysis was performed, and Western blot analysis
      was used to verify the effects of the novel mutations on INSR protein expression.
      RESULTS: Direct INSR sequencing identified the following 2 novel compound
      heterozygous mutations in the beta-subunit of INSR: p.Arg1066* and p.Gln1232*.
      Western blot analysis of skin fibroblasts revealed a comparable expression of the
      alpha-subunit of INSR in mutant and control samples, but reduced levels of mature
      INSR beta-subunit protein were found in mutant INSR-expressing cells in
      comparison to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the clinical course
      of a male patient with Donohue syndrome and the molecular characteristics of 2
      novel compound heterozygous mutations in INSR. These novel nonsense mutations are
      associated with reduced expression of the mature INSR beta-subunit, which was
      most likely due to impaired proreceptor processing.

AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS) is a very rare autosomal recessive disease affecting less
      than one in a million live births. It represents the most severe form of insulin 
      resistance due to mutations involving the insulin receptor gene. DS is
      characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation with failure to thrive,
      lipoatrophy, muscle wasting, acanthosis nigricans, hypertrichosis, and dysmorphic
      features. Glucose homeostasis is affected with hyperinsulinemia, fasting
      hypoglycemia, and postprandial hyperglycemia. We report a Jordanian patient with 
      genetically proven DS who had the classical physical features, progressive
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cholestasis, and hyperglycemia, followed by
      hypoglycemia. In addition, the patient developed polyuria and uremia despite
      normal creatinine levels, hypernatremia, and hypertension. To our knowledge,
      these metabolic derangements were not previously reported in patients with DS.

AB  - AIM: Leprechaunism, a rare genetic disease resulting from mutations in two
      alleles of the insulin receptor gene, is characterized by severe insulin
      resistance, retarded growth and, usually, premature death. The ability of
      treatment with recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rhIGF1) to improve
      metabolic and clinical parameters in the long-term is still controversial.
      METHODS: Mutations were looked for in the insulin receptor gene of a
      four-month-old female baby with leprechaunism. The patient's skin fibroblasts
      were analyzed for response to insulin and IGF1. At the clinical level, the very
      long-term effects of treatment with rhIGF1/rhIGFBP3 were evaluated by clinical
      and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: The patient's diagnosis was based on compound 
      heterozygous mutations in two alleles of the insulin receptor gene, thus
      confirming leprechaunism. Cultured fibroblasts showed a decreased number of
      insulin receptors and were insulin-resistant. However, IGF1 was able to stimulate
      IGF1 receptor signalling, suggesting possible activation of a salvage pathway.
      Treatment with IGF1/IGFBP3 for 8.7 years, then IGF1 for 2 years, resulted in
      normalization of circulating levels of IGF1 and IGFBP3. Large daily variations in
      glycaemia and insulinaemia persisted, but mean glycaemia decreased. Regarding
      growth, the patient's BMI Z score normalized and length/height score improved.
      Our patient presented normal neurological development and academic achievement.
      The treatment was free of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Our results provide
      evidence that rhIGF1 with and without rhIGFBP3 can prevent fatal outcomes, and
      improve growth and metabolic parameters, for more than 10 years in a patient with
      leprechaunism. Long-term rhIGF1 for severe insulin resistance syndrome should be 
      considered.

AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS) is a severe form of congenital insulin resistance due to
      mutation(s) in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. Given the similarities between
      insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors, recombinant human
      IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) has been used to treat severe insulin resistance due to INSR
      mutation(s). Traditional subcutaneous therapy may be limited by the shortened
      IGF-1 half-life in these patients. We report the case of a female with
      molecularly confirmed DS treated with continuous rhIGF-1 therapy via an insulin
      pump. With treatment, the patient's hemoglobin A1c decreased from 9.8% to 8.8%,
      and her weight increased by 0.8 kg. Development of an ovarian tumor complicated
      her course, but it was unclear whether this was related to rhIGF-1 therapy.
      Limited treatment options exist for patients with DS. The use of continuous
      rhIGF-1 via an insulin pump may be a viable option, although further experience
      is needed to establish safety and efficacy.

TI  - A syndrome of insulin resistance resembling Donohue syndrome with patent ductus
      arteriosus.
PG  - 315-7
AB  - Donohue syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is associated with the
      mutation of the insulin receptor gene in the short arm of the 19th chromosome. It
      is very rare that a syndrome of insulin resistance resembles Donohue syndrome
      with patent ductus arteriosus. A 14-year-old girl, whose parents were
      consanguineous, was often admitted for abdominal pain over the past 8 years. She 
      presented not only polydipsia, polyphagia, and weight loss but also small elfin
      face, distended abdomen, enlarged clitoris, hypertrichosis, acanthosis nigricans 
      of the neck, decreased subcutaneous fat and 3/6 continuous murmur radiating to
      the right shoulder with thrill on 2nd to 3rd left sternal border. In addition,
      she had hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinism, and patent ductus arteriosus by
      laboratory examination and echocardiography, respectively. This child shows
      insulin resistance resembling Donohue syndrome with patent ductus arteriosus.
      Most of patients with Donohue syndrome die prematurely. The child surviving for a
      long time may have a milder form of Donohue syndrome and may be due to a less
      severe form of the defective gene. Chromosomal abnormalities may be also
      associated with this disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several types of mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been
      identified in patients with genetic syndromes of insulin resistance. PATIENT
      REPORT: We describe a 12-year-old girl with type A insulin resistance with
      hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, and diabetes mellitus but without the
      dysmorphic characteristic of leprechaunism or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. The
      proband's mother had hyperinsulinemia and diabetes mellitus but did not show any 
      common clinical features of type A insulin resistance. The proband's brother also
      had hyperinsulinemia but manifested neither glucose intolerance nor common
      clinical features of type A insulin resistance. A novel heterozygous mutation,
      p.Asn1164Thr, of the insulin receptor gene (INSR) was identified in this family. 
      CONCLUSION: These cases illustrate the diversity of clinical phenotypes
      associated with mutations of the insulin receptor gene.

AB  - Donohue syndrome or leprechaunism is a severe congenital insulin-resistance
      syndrome. It is characterized by intra-uterine and neonatal growth retardation,
      typical dysmorphic features, and metabolic abnormalities with hyperinsulinism and
      hyperandrogenism. Problems in energy metabolism and loss of glucose homeostasis
      are responsible for early death in the first year of life. We describe a case
      with a novel homozygote mutation in the insulin receptor gene. This patient had
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with heart failure and bronchial compression leading 
      to clinical deterioration over 5 days and subsequently death. A treatment with
      recombinant IGF-1 was tried without efficacy.

TI  - Metreleptin improves blood glucose in patients with insulin receptor mutations.
PG  - E1749-56
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-2317 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is caused by mutations of the insulin
      receptor and results in extreme insulin resistance and dysglycemia. Hyperglycemia
      in RMS is very difficult to treat, and patients are at risk for early morbidity
      and mortality from complications of diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to
      study 1-year effects of recombinant human methionyl leptin (metreleptin) in 5
      patients with RMS and 10-year effects in 2 of these patients. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      We conducted an open-label nonrandomized study at the National Institutes of
      Health. PATIENTS: Patients were adolescents with RMS and poorly controlled
      diabetes. INTERVENTION: Two patients were treated with escalating doses (0.02 up 
      to 0.22 mg/kg/d) of metreleptin for 10 years, including 3 cycles of metreleptin
      withdrawal and reinitiation. In all 5 patients, 1-year effects of metreleptin
      (0.22 mg/kg/d) were studied. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body
      mass index (BMI) z-scores were evaluated every 6 months. RESULTS: HbA1c decreased
      from 11.4% +/- 1.1% at baseline to 9.3% +/- 1.9% after 6 months and 9.7% +/- 1.6%
      after 12 months of metreleptin (P = .007). In patients treated for 10 years,
      HbA1c declined with each cycle of metreleptin and rose with each withdrawal. BMI 
      z-scores declined from -1.4 +/- 1.8 at baseline, to -2.6 +/- 1.6 after 12 months 
      of metreleptin (P = .0006). Changes in BMI z-score correlated with changes in
      HbA1c (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Metreleptin treatment for 12 months was
      associated with a 1.7% reduction in HbA1c; part of this improvement was likely
      mediated via decreased BMI. Metreleptin is a promising treatment option for RMS, 
      but additional therapies are needed to achieve HbA1c targets.

TI  - Six cases with severe insulin resistance (SIR) associated with mutations of
      insulin receptor: Is a Bartter-like syndrome a feature of congenital SIR?
PG  - 951-7
LID - 10.1007/s00592-013-0490-x [doi]
AB  - Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of
      severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and
      Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to
      differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients
      with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can
      reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with
      hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR). We
      studied the INSR gene in five subjects with congenital SIR and in a patient with 
      type A SIR. Nine biallelic INSR gene mutations (eight novels, including an
      in-frame deletion of INSR signal peptide) were identified in patients with
      congenital SIR; a heterozygous, spontaneous INSR mutation was detected in the
      patient with type A SIR. Two probands, presenting severe hirsutism at birth, died
      at the age of 3 months and were classified as DS, while other 2, currently 2 and 
      3 years old, were diagnosed with RMS (patients 3 and 4). The fifth patient with
      congenital SIR died when 14 months old. Nephrocalcinosis, hyperaldosteronism,
      hyperreninemia, and hypokalemia, in the absence of hypertension, were discovered 
      in patients 3 and 5 when 24 and 4 months old, respectively. Patient 3, now 3
      years/3 months old, still shows hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism requiring
      potassium supplementation. We conclude that renal abnormalities resembling
      antenatal Bartter's syndrome type II, recently reported also by others, is a
      common observation in patients with congenital SIR.

AB  - Syndrome of extreme insulin resistance (SEIR) is a rare spectrum disorder with a 
      primary defect in insulin receptor signalling, noted primarily in children, and
      is often difficult to diagnose due to the clinical heterogeneity.SEIR was
      diagnosed in an adolescent girl with facial dysmorphism,exuberant scalp and body 
      hair, severe acanthosis, lipoatrophy, dental abnormalities, and short stature
      (Rabson-Mendenhall phenotype). She had elevated fasting (422.95 pmol/L) and
      post-glucose insulin levels(>2083 pmol/L). Total body fat was decreased (11%;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). Basal growth hormone (GH) was increased (7.9
      mug/L)with normal insuline-like growth factor 1 (37.6 nmol/L) suggestive of GH
      resistance. She had fatty liver and polycystic ovaries. Echocardiography revealed
      ostium secundum type atrial septal defect (ASD). Blood glucose normalized with
      pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Delayed development, severe insulin resistance, mild
      hyperglycemia, absence of ketosis, and remarkable response of hyperinsulinemia
      and hyperglycemia to pioglitazone which persisted even after 1 year of diagnosis 
      are some of the notable features of this patient. This is perhaps the first
      report of occurrence of congenital heart disease (ASD) in a patient of SEIR
      (Rabson-Mendenhall phenotype). This report highlights the clinical features of
      SEIR and the role of insulin sensitizers like pioglitazone in the management of
      such patients.

AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized
      by extreme insulin resistance and certain characteristic phenotypic features. The
      primary defect lies in the insulin receptor and involves biallelic mutations that
      lead to a loss of function through various postulated defects. We present a
      9-year-old female patient with RMS complicated by multiple cerebral infarcts, in 
      whom genetic analysis revealed a novel insulin receptor mutation.

TI  - Rare types of diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 700-7
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a heterogenous disorder characterized by chronic
      hyperglycemia and induced by a large number of etiopathogenic conditions. Beside 
      type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which account for almost 90% of all cases,
      practitioners may encounter patients with more infrequent forms of diabetes, as
      those induced by mutations of a single gene, atypical immune disorders or
      neonatal diabetes. Monogenic diabetes is represented by genetic disorders in the 
      structure of the beta-cell (the MODY syndromes and the mutations of mitochondrial
      DNA) or in the insulin's action (type A insulin resistance syndrome,
      Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, leprechaunism, lipodystrophies). The rare forms of
      immune diabetes are determined by antibodies against insulin or insulin receptor 
      or appear as a component of the "stiff man syndrome". Neonatal diabetes is
      induced by mutations in genes that control beta-cell development and function and
      may have a transient or permanent nature. Knowledge of the uncommon forms of
      diabetes mellitus enables physicians to apply the optimal treatment, to estimate 
      the evolution of the patient and to apply a complete family screening in order to
      diagnose all other blood relatives as soon as possible.

AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder affecting
      insulin receptor. This disorder is characterized by insulin-resistant diabetes
      mellitus, hyperinsulinemia, deficiency of subcutaneous fat, acanthosis nigrican, 
      growth retardation, coarse and senile appearance, precocious puberty, and dental 
      prematurity, enlarged genitalia, and pineal hyperplasia. Mutations of the insulin
      receptor gene affecting insulin action appear to be the basic mechanism
      underlying this syndrome. Herein, we present a case report on Rabson-Mendenhall
      syndrome in a 9-year-old girl.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism; OMIM *246200) is a rare, recessively
      inherited disorder of extreme insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin 
      receptor gene (INSR) causing either defects in insulin binding or receptor
      autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity. We report a patient with
      pronounced clinical picture of leprechaunism who developed severe progressive
      hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and renal tubular dysfunction
      which improved on continuous subcutaneous infusion of recombinant human
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-I). INSR gene molecular analysis and insulin 
      receptor (IR) autophosphorylation on cultured fibroblasts were performed. A novel
      homozygous missense mutation p.Leu795Pro was found, located in the extracellular 
      portion of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. The post-binding defect of
      the insulin receptor signaling in cultured fibroblasts demonstrated decreased
      insulin receptor autophosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Treatment with rhIGF-I
      partially reversed severe progressive HOCM and renal tubular dysfunction in a
      patient with Donohue syndrome associated with a novel p.Leu795Pro INSR gene
      mutation causing a severe decrease in IR autophosphorylation.

TI  - Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome): a case bearing novel compound heterozygous
      mutations in the insulin receptor gene.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) is the most severe type of insulin receptor
      (INSR) gene anomaly with the majority of patients surviving for only 2 years. We 
      report a surviving 2 -year-old male with leprechaunism, bearing novel compound
      heterozygous mutations in the INSR. The patient is a Japanese boy with acanthosis
      nigricans, lack of subcutaneous fat, hirsutism, thick lips, gum hypertrophy and
      extremely high insulin levels (6702 mU/mL). He was as having identified novel
      compound heterozygous mutations in INSR (p.T910M and p. E1047K). At 24 day-old,
      recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rh-IGF1) treatment was started
      because of poor weight gain. At 2 years old, the patient's serum glucose level
      and HbA1C value had worsened, and both a bolus of rh-IGF-1 and a subcutaneous
      injection of a rapid-acting insulin analog after meals, in addition to
      alpha-glycosidase inhibitor, were initiated from 2 years onward. Oxygen
      administration and biphasic positive airway pressure treatment were also
      initiated from 2 years old due to upper airway obstruction with adenoidal
      hypertrophy. In the experiments conducted using COS7 cells homozygously
      transfected with the INSR mutation, T910M INSR failed to process the proreceptor 
      and decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. E1047K INSR resulted
      in a complete absence of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. These
      findings suggest the near absence of INSR in this patient. We consider that the
      rhIGF1 treatment contributed to his long survival, but it was not able to prevent
      his diabetic condition. Our report provides important insights into the function 
      of INSR, and for the treatment of leprechaunism.

TI  - A case of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome with a novel mutation in the tyrosine kinase
      domain of the insulin receptor gene complicated by medullary sponge kidney.
PG  - 587-90
AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is a genetic disorder characterized by severe
      insulin resistance and somatic characteristics. Recombinant insulin-like growth
      factor 1 (r-IGF-1) is used to treat RMS, as the IGF-1 and insulin receptors share
      homology. However, the effect of r-IGF-1 varies in patients and it is difficult
      to manage metabolic status appropriately in r-IGF-1 resistant cases. We report a 
      Japanese boy with RMS who showed resistance to r-IGF-1 therapy and a novel
      mutation in the insulin receptor in the tyrosine kinase domain. Mutations in this
      region disturb tyrosine kinase catalytic activity in IGF-1 receptors as a result 
      of dominant negative effects. We consider this mutation to be the cause of
      resistance to r-IGF-1. The patient also exhibited radiographical features of
      medullary sponge kidney and had severe nephrocalcinosis and hypokalemia,
      indicating Bartter syndrome. However, analysis revealed no mutations in the
      responsible genes and the etiology of the renal abnormalities therefore remains
      unknown.

TI  - A novel mutation of the insulin receptor gene in a preterm infant with Donohue
      syndrome and heart failure.
PG  - 363-6
AB  - Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations
      in the gene encoding the insulin receptor. It is characterised by severe
      metabolic and endocrine derangement, prenatal and postnatal linear growth
      impairment, soft tissue overgrowth, and poor development of adipose tissue and
      muscle. Causes of death, which is often within the first year of life, include
      intercurrent infection and, in some cases, heart failure. Management is currently
      based on case reports and very small case series only, and no formal guidelines
      or recommendations exist. We describe a preterm infant who had typical features
      of DS but who later developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with heart failure
      leading to death at 10 weeks old. Molecular genetic analysis revealed compound
      heterozygosity for the previously reported p.Arg890X nonsense mutation and the
      novel p.Tyr818Cys missense mutation in the INSR gene. Tyrosine 818 falls in an
      exquisitely conserved residue of the alphabeta fibronectin domain of the insulin 
      receptor, whose structure and function are much less well understood than other
      parts of the receptor. We discuss management options for DS, including the
      therapeutic dilemma around whether recombinant human insulin-like growth factor
      1, one of the few available treatments for the syndrome, may exacerbate
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure.

AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is a rare syndrome manifested by extreme insulin
      resistance with hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans, tooth dysplasia and
      growth retardation. Our patient was first noted at the age of 8 months due to
      pigmentations on skin-folded areas. Initial laboratory tests showed normal
      fasting glucose (69 mg/dL). Fasting insulin level was severely elevated, up to
      554.6 microIU/mL, and c-peptide level was increased, up to 13.81 ng/mL. However, 
      hemoglobin A1c was within normal range (4.8%). He is now 11 yr old. His growth
      development followed the 5-10th percentile and oral hypoglycemic agents are being
      administered. The last laboratory results showed insulin 364.1 microIU/mL,
      C-peptide 4.30 ng/mL, and hemoglobin A1c 7.6%. The boy was a compound
      heterozygote for the c.90C > A and c.712G > A mutations of the insulin receptor
      gene, INSR, which are nonsense and missense mutations. In summary, we report the 
      first Korean case of RMS, which was confirmed by two novel mutations of the INSR.

AB  - Areolar hyperplasia is only reported when exaggerated, and even so, exaggerated
      areolar sebaceous hyperplasia is rare. We have recently seen a case of areolar
      sebaceous hyperplasia in a 32-year-old woman with Donohue syndrome
      (leprechaunism), who also had an invasive ductal carcinoma in the same breast.
      The patient showed typical "elfin-like" face with wide nostrils and thick lips,
      large and low-set ears, and dysplastic nails. The areola showed a yellowish
      thickened plaque of 5-cm diameter that corresponded to a hyperplasia of the
      sebaceous glands. Immunohistochemistry for the mismatch repair proteins (MLH1,
      MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) was performed on the sebaceous hyperplasia and on the
      breast carcinoma, and no lack of expression of the markers was evidenced. We have
      found no other reported case of areolar sebaceous hyperplasia either in cases of 
      breast carcinoma or in cases of leprechaunism.

TI  - Functional characterization of insulin receptor gene mutations contributing to
      Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome - phenotypic heterogeneity of insulin receptor gene
      mutations.
PG  - 931-40
AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is a rare disorder that presents as severe
      insulin resistance as a result of mutations present in the insulin receptor
      (INSR). A Chinese girl with RMS presented with profound diabetes,
      hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, and abnormalities of teeth and
      nails. Direct sequencing of the patient's INSR detected heterozygote mutations at
      Arg83Gln (R83Q) and Ala1028Val (A1028V), with the former representing a novel
      mutation. Functional studies of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected
      with wild-type (WT) and mutant forms of INSR were performed to evaluate the
      effects of these mutations on receptor expression and activation. Receptor
      expression, insulin binding activity, and phosphorylation of the R83Q variant
      were comparable to WT. In contrast, expression of the A1028V receptor was much
      lower than that of WT INSR, and impairment of insulin binding and
      autophosphorylation were nearly commensurate with the decrease in expression
      detected. Reductions in the phosphorylation of IRS-1, Akt, and Erk1/2 (60%, 40%, 
      and 50% of WT, respectively) indicate that the A1028V receptor contributes to
      impaired signal transduction. In conclusion, INSR mutations associated with RMS
      were identified. Moreover, the A1028V mutation associated with a decrease in
      expression of INSR potentially accounts for loss of function of the INSR.

TI  - [Insulin receptor defect as a cause of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome and other rare 
      genetic insulin resistance syndromes].
PG  - 205-12
AB  - Insulin plays a very important role in maintaining homeostasis of the whole
      organism. It regulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, lipid and protein 
      metabolism. Insulin receptors are present in virtually all cells, which is
      reflected by the diversity of regulatory processes in which this hormone is
      involved. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin
      receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance,
      including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, which
      differ in the level of severity. Molecular analysis of insulin receptor gene may 
      lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying various types
      of insulin resistance and help to develop a more efficient treatment. They may
      also be used as a powerful tool in prenatal diagnostics as well as in pregnancy
      planning.

AB  - Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized 
      by insulin resistance syndrome, growth retardation, coarse and senile-looking
      faces, mental precocity, early dentition, and pineal hyperplasia. Mutations of
      the insulin receptor gene affecting insulin action appear to be the basic
      mechanism underlying this syndrome. We report on Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome in
      two siblings and briefly review the literature.

LID - 10.1007/s10059-010-0017-z [doi]
AB  - Although mutations in the insulin receptor have been causally implicated with
      leprechaunism, the full pathophysiology of the syndrome cannot be accounted for
      by malfunction of this gene alone. We sought to characterize a connection between
      Wnt-mediated cell signaling and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      which revealed a novel mechanistic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of
      leprechaunism. To identify candidate genes involved in this process, a PCR-based 
      subtractive hybridization was performed. Candidate genes were examined for
      interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway and ROS generation. We found that
      Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a Wnt inhibitor, is overexpressed in skin fibroblast cells
      derived from three leprechaunism patients and that the cells showed an impaired
      response to Wnt2 in terms of beta-catenin-Tcf activation. Knockdown of Dkk1 in
      the patient cell lines rescued Wnt2-mediated Tcf activation. Concerted action of 
      Wnt2 and knockdown of Dkk1 resulted in enhanced Nox4 expression and PDGF-induced 
      ROS generation compared to parental patient cells. Furthermore, we found that
      NFATc2 was activated in response to Wnt2 stimulation and directly activates Nox4 
      expression. These data show a crosstalk between Wnt and ROS pathways which in
      turn provides new mechanistic insights at the molecular level into the
      pathogenesis of leprechaunism.

TI  - Sustained regression of florid diabetic retinopathy in a patient with Donohue
      syndrome (leprechaunism).
PG  - 224-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Leprechaunism is a rare congenital syndrome caused by mutations of the
      insulin receptor gene, transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Insulin
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) treatment can be a therapeutic option in this syndrome by
      its insulin-like effects. Nevertheless, it is of note that IGF-1 has also an
      angiogenic activity. METHODS: Fundus examination by ophthalmoscopy,
      fluorangiography, and laser treatment were performed. RESULTS: A 17-year-old girl
      with leprechaunism, under treatment with high doses of insulin, presented a
      florid diabetic retinopathy. The large neovascularization of the disk regressed
      after treatment with argon laser panretinal photocoagulation. Five years after
      treatment, the patient maintained good vision. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case is
      of interest for 2 reasons: 1) the large retinal neovascularization was likely due
      to the high insulin dosages; 2) this is the first case in which a sustained
      regression of retinal neovascularization has been observed after laser treatment 
      in leprechaunism.
