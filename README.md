# BD2K
This repository is a compilation of all the projects I've worked on in my laboratory Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Center of Excellence at UCLA. 

Currently, I am participating in various research projects in a biomedical lab (Big Data to Knowledge Center of Excellence) at UCLA. Initially, there was a steep learning curve for me because of gaps in my knowledge with biomedical jargon. So, I thought it would be helpful to define some terms before you delve into my projects. 

_PubMed_ is an online database that “[comprises over 28 million citations for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. PubMed citations and abstracts include the fields of biomedicine and health, covering portions of the life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/)”

_MeSH term_ is “the acronym for "[Medical Subject Headings. MeSH is the authority list of the vocabulary terms … used for indexing journal articles for MEDLINE and is also used for cataloging books and audiovisuals… It imposes uniformity and consistency to the indexing of biomedical literature. MeSH terms are arranged in a hierarchical categorized manner.](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/pubmedtutorial/015_010.html)”

_PMID_ “[is the unique identifier number used in PubMed. They are assigned to each article record when it enters the PubMed system.](https://asklib.hsl.unc.edu/faq/193442)”

Now that we all have a foundation of the critical terms related to my project, feel free to jump right to any of my projects.
